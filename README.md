## YMDD_Frontoamygdalar_DCM

# Main results
The H_MDD_PEB_and_LOO.m script will reproduce the DCM results comparing MDD patients to healthy controls reported in the Kung et al., manuscript.* 

The Remission_PEB_and_LOO.m script will reproduce the DCM results comparing remitters to non-remitters reported in the manuscript.

# Exploratory analyses
The PBO_Remission_PEB_and_LOO.m script will reproduce the DCM results comparing remitters to non-remitters in the CBT + placebo group reported in the manuscript.

The FLX_Remission_PEB_and_LOO.m script will reproduce the DCM results comparing remitters to non-remitters in the CBT + fluoxetine group reported in the manuscript.

# Supplemental information
The Remission_rmcov_PEB_and_LOO.m script will reproduce the DCM results comparing remitters to non-remitters using the model without demographic and treatment arm covariates reported in the Online Supplement of the Kung et al., manuscript.

The H_MDD_Edyears_PEB.m script will reproduce the DCM results comparing MDD patients to healthy controls using a model with education attainment covariate reported in the Online Supplement of the Kung et al., manuscript.*

# Notes
*Due to large file size (>100MB), H_MDD_GCM.mat containing subject-level DCM estimates of both healthy controls and MDD patients should be downloaded on its own and placed in the same directory as the .m script files.
